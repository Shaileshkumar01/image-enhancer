export const ETHEREAL_PROMPT = `Apply an ethereal lighting filter to the uploaded photo while fully preserving every original detail of the photo unchanged except for lighting, glow, and color mood. Add diffused sunbeams striking the subject's skin, creating a glowing highlight on cheekbones, nose bridge, lips, and hair strands. Maintain clear separation between bright sunlit areas and soft, deep shadows to create a cinematic high-contrast mood. Inject subtle lens bloom, light haze, and a thin layer of atmospheric glow around the face and shoulders. Render skin with luminous translucency and gentle peachy tones. Enhance stray hair strands backlit by sunlight. Color-grade with slightly lowered saturation, and gentle film-like grain. Keep the overall background intact but allow sunlight flares and soft bokeh to wrap naturally around the subject. The result should look like a soft, ethereal daydream-sunlit, delicate, and cinematic.

Hard rule: Do not change the face and hairs of the subject.`;
